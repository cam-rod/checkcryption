Necessary Files

[] userdata.txt (Usernames and passswords are stored here)
[] Textcryption.py (Main Program, calls everything else and cycles options)

[] crypter.py (Encyption/Decryption)
[] accounts.py (Usernames/passwords as objects, signin, save to userdata.txt)

TIPS:
- To regenerate the objects for each user, the code to create them must be run at import time. The best way to
do this is by returning all objects in a list.
- Use return without arguments to end a function quickly
