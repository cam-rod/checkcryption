Necessary Files

[] users.txt (Usernames and encrypted usernames are stored here)
[] Textcryption.py (Main Program, calls everything else and cycles options)

[] crypter.py (Encyption/Decryption only, using password. Class is used to allow for property, quick delete) 
[] accounts.py (Usernames/encrypted usernames stores as objects, signin/create account with unencrypted username)
  - Passwords are also stored here during use, in a hashed form
[] text-parser.py (Reads and writes data, both for plaintext and files used by crypt.py and accounts.py)

TIPS:
  - To regenerate the objects for each user, the code to create them must be run at import time. The best way to
  do this is by returning all objects in a list.
  - Use return without arguments to end a function quickly
  - Don't forget to delete the plaintext password and the encryption key as soon as it isn't needed.

Username requirements: None

Password requirements:
  - EXACTLY 8 characters
  - Alphanumeric()[]!@#,.*/
