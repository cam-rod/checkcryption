Necessary Files

[] users.txt (Usernames and encrypted usernames are stored here)
[] Textcryption.py (Main Program, calls everything else and cycles options)

[x] crypter.py (Encryption/Decryption only, using password. Class is used to allow for property, quick delete)
[] text-parser.py (Reads and writes data, both for plaintext and files used by crypter.py)
  - Input and verify password
  - Read files for crypting
  - Read plaintext for crypting
  - Write to crypted file (old or new)
  - Read from users.txt
  - Write to users.txt

TIPS:
  - Use semicolons to seperate unencrypted usernames from encrypted usernames
  - Use return without arguments to end a function quickly
  - Don't forget to delete the plaintext password and the encryption key as soon as it isn't needed.
  - Use .insert(where, what) to salt

  - use ' '.join("{:08b}".format(ord(x), 'b') for x in TEXT) to convert text to binary
