Necessary Files

[x] users.txt (Usernames and encrypted usernames are stored here)
[x] textcryption.py (Main Program, calls everything else and cycles options)

[] crypter.py (Encryption/Decryption only, using password. Class is used to allow for property, quick delete)
    [x] Key Generation
    [] Encrypter/Decrypter
[x] text_parser.py (Reads and writes data, both for plaintext and files used by crypter.py)
    [x] Input and verify password
    [x] Read files for crypting
    [x] Read plaintext for crypting
    [x] Write to crypted file (old or new)
    [x] Read from users.txt

TIPS:
    - Use semicolons to separate unencrypted usernames from encrypted usernames
    - Use return without arguments to end a function quickly
    - Don't forget to delete the plaintext password and the encryption key as soon as it isn't needed.
    - Use .insert(where, what) to salt

    - use .encode() to convert text to binary
